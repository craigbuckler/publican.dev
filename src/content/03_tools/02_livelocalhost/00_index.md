LiveLocalhost is a simple localhost development web server with hot reloading. It serves web files from any local directory, watches for file changes, and triggers automated browser refreshes.

You can configure and run LiveLocalhost from:

1. the command line using CLI or environment variable settings, or
1. in a Node.js application using the API.

The [Basic Publican theme template](--ROOT--about/links/#basic-publican-theme) and the [Publican.dev website](--ROOT--about/links/#publicandev-website) use LiveLocalhost.
