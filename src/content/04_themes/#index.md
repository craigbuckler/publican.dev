The following pre-built Publican themes can be used and adapted for your own website.


## Basic theme

The basic theme is fast, standards based, uses best practise techniques, and is an ideal starting point for a personal blog. It features pages, blog posts, tag indexes, desktop/mobile responsive layout, light/dark switcher (shown below), RSS feed, sitemaps, security, and a 100% Lighthouse performance score.

The theme can quicky be configured by [editing an `.env` file](https://publican-theme-basic.pages.dev/blog/basic-configuration/) and changing colors using [CSS custom properties](https://publican-theme-basic.pages.dev/blog/updating-css/#corevariablescss).
