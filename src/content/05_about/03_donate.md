  Accepts cards and business invoice payments. A Github account is required.

  Accepts cards and PayPal.


Donors receive:

1. Expediated support and consideration for potential new features.

1. An optional link on this website *(vetted by me, so nothing illegal or of dubious origin, please!)*

1. A sense of enormous wellbeing.
